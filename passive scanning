Passive scanning is a non-intrusive technique that collects information about a system or network without sending any packets to the target.
It relies on monitoring traffic in transit — making it stealthy and undetectable by firewalls or IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems).

🔹 1. Set up the Environment
Make sure Burp Suite Community Edition is installed (you already followed this part).

Launch Burp Suite, start a Temporary Project and click Start Burp.

Ensure Intercept is ON under the Proxy tab.

🔹 2. Configure Your Browser to Use Burp Suite Proxy
Example uses Firefox:

Open Firefox, go to about:preferences

Scroll to Network Settings → Click Settings

Choose Manual proxy configuration:

HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1

Port: 8080

Check: “Use this proxy server for all protocols”

Click OK

🔹 3. Import Burp CA Certificate for HTTPS Sites
Open browser and go to: http://burp

Download the CA Certificate (cacert.der)

In Firefox:

Go to about:preferences → Privacy & Security

Under Certificates, click View Certificates

Import the downloaded certificate under the Authorities tab

Check "Trust this CA to identify websites"

🔹 4. Start Passive Scanning
Now open any website in Firefox — e.g., http://testphp.vulnweb.com or any vulnerable site you’re legally allowed to test.

Burp will intercept the request under Proxy → Intercept.

Turn off Intercept to allow the request to go through.

Go to HTTP history tab under Proxy:

You will see a list of all HTTP/S requests made.

Click on any request to see details:

Request headers

Cookies

User-agent

Parameters

URLs

Sessions, tokens

This is passive scanning: You are not scanning the target actively. You're just monitoring traffic that your browser generates, and observing behaviors, endpoints, technologies, headers, and security details.

🔹 5. Information You Can Passively Gather:
Technologies in use (PHP, Apache, etc.)

Session tokens in cookies or headers

URL endpoints and parameters

User-agent headers

Response codes (403, 404, 200, 500, etc.)

Possible sensitive info leaks (emails, internal IPs)

Redirects

Server banners
